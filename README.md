### Context Notes

Run your responses against the automated test suites provided by LeetCode and HackerRank while using SQL reference materials to construct your answers.

Foundational knowledge for working with relational databases is important if you are creating or maintaining web applications with persistent storage. Sometimes to overhead of learning how to use a new SQL client or a library (for example, the Sequelize ORM, pg-promise, or the KnexJS query builder) detracts from learning these foundational concepts.

This project provides the opportunity to focus on this core knowledge so working with SQL clients and ORMs will be easier in a 'real-world' environment.

The exercises to reinforce conceptual knowledge emphasize the importance of knowing how to make solid DB design decisions. Being able to write SQL queries is an important skill, but being able to design a schema that minimizes redundancy and maximizes reliable and painless access to data will pay dividends.
